# Project Overview

The purpose of this term project is to put your C++ Object Oriented skills to practice by developing a simulated Assembly Line.

The project simulates an assembly line that fills customer orders from inventory. Each customer order consists of a list of items that need to be filled. The line consists of a set of stations. Each station holds an inventory of items for filling customer orders and a queue of orders to be filled. Each station fills the next order in the queue if that order requests its item and that item is still in stock. A line manager moves the customer orders from station to station until all orders have been processed. Any station that has used all of the items in stock cannot fill any more orders. Orders become incomplete due to a lack of inventory at one or more stations. At the end of all processing, the line manager lists the completed orders and the orders that are incomplete.

The project is broken down into 3 milestones to help guide you through the process of implementing, debugging and execution of a more complex application than a regular lab/workshop.

# Milestone 1

## `Utilities` and `Station` classes

This milestone will implement and test the `Utilities` and `Station` classes.

- `Utilities` class is an object used to support the parsing of input files to setup and configure the assembly line simulation.
- `Station` class encapsulates the information about a given station on the assembly line that fills customer orders.

The specifications of the classes are defined below.


### `Utilities` Class

Parsing string data from input files is performed the same way for all objects within the system.  The `Utilities` type provides the basic functionality required for all objects in the assembly line system.

Each `Utilities` object holds the following information:
-  `m_widthField` -- specifying the length of the token extracted; used for display purpose later; default value is `1`.
-  `m_delimiter` -- separates the tokens from a given `std::string`. All `Utilities` objects **share the same delimiter**.

The member functions of the `Utilities` class include:
-  `void setFieldWidth(size_t newWidth)` -- sets the field width of the current object to the value of the parameter
-  `size_t getFieldWidth() const` -- returns the field width of the current object
-  `std::string extractToken(const std::string& str, size_t& next_pos, bool& more)` -- extracts tokens from the first parameter
    - This function uses the delimiter to extract the next token from `str` starting at `next_pos`.
    - If successful, it returns the extracted token found and sets `more` to `true`; `false` otherwise.
    - This function reports an exception if there are two delimiters with no token between them.
    - This function updates the current object's `m_widthField` data member if its current value is less than the size of the token extracted.
    - **Note:**  `str` represents a single line read from an input file
-  `static void setDelimiter(char newDelimiter)` -- sets the delimiter for this class to the character received
-  `static char getDelimiter()` -- returns the delimiter character.



### `Station` Class

An `Station` object manages a single station on the assembly line. Each station handles a single item in the customer order.

Each `Station` holds the following information:
- the id of a station (integer)
- the name of the item handled that the station (array of characters)
- the description of the station (array of characters)
- the next serial number to be assigned to an item at this station (integer)
- the number of current items left in stock (integer)


***Static Data***

- `m_widthField` -- the maximum characters required to print to screen the *item name*, *serial number* and *quantity* for any object of type `Station`.  Initial value is 0.
- `id_generator` -- a variable used to generate IDs for new instances of type `Station`. Every time a new instance is created, the current value of the `id_generator` is stored in the instance, and `id_generator` is incremented.  Initial value is 0.


***Public Functions***

-  custom constructor
  - upon instantiation, an `Station` object receives a reference to an unmodifiable `std::string`.  This string contains a single record (one line) that has been retrieved from the input file specified by the user.
  - the constructor uses an `Utilities` object (created local in the function) to extract each token from the record and populates the `Station` object accordingly.
  - **Note:**  You can assume that a record from the file contains 4 fields separated by a delimiter, in the following order:
    - name of the item
    - starting serial number
    - quantity in stock
    - description
  - the delimiter of the tokens is a single character, specified by the client and stored into the `Utilities` object.
  - once the constructor has extracted *name*, *starting serial number*, and *quantity* from the record, it updates `Station::m_widthField` to the maximum value of `Station::m_widthField` and `Utilities::m_widthField`.
  - **Note:**  the `display(...)` member function uses this field width to align the output across all of the records retrieved from the file.

-  `const std::string& getItemName() const` - returns the name of the current `Station` object
-  `unsigned int getNextSerialNumber()` – returns the next serial number to be used on the assembly line and increments `m_serialNumber`
-  `unsigned int getQuantity() const` – returns the remaining quantity of the current `Station` object
-  `void updateQuantity()` – subtracts 1 from the available quantity; should not go below 0.
-  `void display(std::ostream& os, bool full) const` -- inserts the content of the current object into first parameter.
  - if the second parameter is `false`, this function inserts only the ID, name and serial number in the format: `[ID] Item: NAME [SERIAL]`
  - if the second parameter if `true`, this function uses the following format: `[ID] Item NAME [SERIAL] Quantity: QTY Description: DESCRIPTION`
  - `ID` field will use 3 characters, the `NAME` and `QTY` fields will use `m_widthField` characters, serial number field will use 6 characters; the `DESCRIPTION` has no formatting options
  - this function will terminate the printed message with an endline

# Milestone #2

This milestone will implement and test the `CustomerOrder` class.

The `CustomerOrder` module contains all the functionality for handling customer orders as they move along the assembly line. As the line manager moves an order along the assembly line, the station where that order currently rests fills a request for an item of that station, if there is any such request. Once the order has reached the end of the line, the order is either completed or incomplete. One cause of incompleteness is the lack of sufficient items in stock at a station.


## `CustomerOrder` class

A `CustomerOrder` object manages a single order on the assembly line and contains the following information:
- `std::string m_name` – the name of the customer (e.g., John, Sara, etc)
- `std::string m_product` – the name of the product being assembled (e.g., Desktop, Laptop, etc)
- `unsigned int m_cntItem` – a count of the number of items for the customer's order
- `Item** m_lstItem` – a dynamically allocated array of pointers. Each element of the array is a dynamically allocated object of type `Item` (see below). **This is the resource** that your class must manage.
- `static size_t m_widthField` – the maximum width of a field, used for display purposes

The member functions of the `CustomerOrder` class include:
- default constructor
- a custom constructor that takes as a parameter a reference to a string containing a single record from the input file.  This constructor uses an `Utilities` object to extract the tokens and populate the current instance. After the extraction is finished, will update `CustomerOrder::m_widthField` if the value stored there is smaller than the value stored in `Utilities::m_widthField`.
  - fields in the record are (separated by a delimiter):
    - Customer Name
    - Order Name
    - the list of items making up the order (at least one item)
- a `CustomerOrder` object should not allow copy operations.  The copy constructor should throw an exception if called and the copy `operator=` should be deleted.
- move constructor. This constructor should "promise" that it doesn't throw exceptions. Use the `noexcept` keyword in the prototype.
- move assignment operator. This operator should "promise" that it doesn't throw exceptions. Use the `noexcept` keyword in the prototype.
- a destructor
- `bool isOrderFilled() const` – returns `true` if all the items in the order have been filled; `false` otherwise
- `bool isItemFilled(const std::string& itemName) const` – returns the `ItemInfo::m_fillState` of the item specified as a parameter. If the item doesn't exist in the order, return `true`.
- `void fillItem(Station& station, std::ostream& os)` – fills the item in the current order that corresponds to the `station` passed into the function.
  - if the order doesn't contain the item handled at the station, this function does nothing
  - if the order contains items handled at the station, and the inventory contains at least one element, then this function subtracts 1 from the inventory and updates `Item::m_serialNumber` and `Item::m_isFilled`. Also it prints the message `    Filled NAME, PRODUCT [ITEM_NAME]`.
  - if the order contains items handled at the station, and the inventory is empty, then this function prints the message `    Unable to fill NAME, PRODUCT [ITEM_NAME]`.
  - all messages printed should be terminated by an endline
- `void display(std::ostream& os) const` – displays the state of the current object in the format (see the sample output for details)
  ```
  CUSTOMER_NAME - PRODUCT
  [SERIAL] ITEM_NAME - STATUS
  [SERIAL] ITEM_NAME - STATUS
  ...
  ```
  - `SERIAL` - a field of width 6
  - `ITEM_NAME` - a field of size `m_widthField`
  - `STATUS` is either `FILLED` or `MISSING`
  - you will have to use IO manipulators for the output.

Also, add to the header `CustomerOrder.h`, the following structure:

```cpp
struct Item
{
	std::string m_itemName;
	unsigned int m_serialNumber = 0;
	bool m_isFilled = false;

	Item(const std::string& src) : m_itemName(src) {};
};
```

## Milestone 3

This milestone will implement and test the `Workstation` and `LineManager` classes.

The `Workstation` class is a simulation of a station on the assembly line and contains all the functionality for filling customer orders with items.  Each `Workstation` is-a `Station` (use inheritance) and is responsible for a particular `Item`.

The `LineManager` class is responsible for the execution and movement of `CustomerOrders` along the assembly line (from start to finish).  The line manager moves orders along the assembly line one step at a time. At each step, each station fills one order. The manager moves orders that are ready from station to station. Once an order has reached the end of the line, it is either completed or is incomplete. An order can be incomplete due to insufficient items in stock to cover its requests.


## `Workstation` Class

A `Workstation` object manages a single `Item` on the assembly line.

`Workstation` inherits from class `Station` and contains the following additional information:
- `m_orders` – is a double ended queue with new `CustomerOrders` coming in one side and exiting out the other once filled.
- `m_pNextStation` – a pointer to the next station on the assembly line



The member functions of the `Workstation` class include:

- a custom constructor -- upon instantiation, a `Workstation` object receives a reference to an unmodifiable `std::string`.  This string contains a single record (one line) that has been retrieved from the input file specified by the user to be used for `Station` instantiation.
  - this constructor will also set the `m_pNextStation` to a safe state. 

- A `Workstation` object represents a single location on the assembly line for filling items into customer orders.  Therefore, a `Workstation` object cannot be copied or moved.   You must make sure this capability has been deleted from your `Workstation` definition.

- `void runProcess(std::ostream&)` – runs a single cycle of the assembly line for the current station.
  - If there are `CustomerOrders` in the queue, this function fills the order in the front at the current `Workstation`.

- `bool moveOrder()` – if the order at the front of the queue doesn't require service at the current station, move it to the next station on the assembly line and return `true`.  Otherwise, do nothing and return `false`.   If the queue is empty, return `false`.

- `void setNextStation(Station& station)` – stores the provided `Station` object's reference into the `m_pNextStation` pointer.

- `const Workstation* getNextStation() const` – return the next station on the assembly line

- `bool getIfCompleted(CustomerOrder& order)` – if the order at the front of the queue is completed, this function removes from the queue, places it in the parameter and returns `true`; otherwise returns `false`.  If the `CustomerOrder` queue is empty, returns `false`.

- `void display(std::ostream&)` – writes the name of the `Item` this `Workstation` is responsible for into the parameter: `ITEM_NAME --> NEXT_ITEM_NAME`
  - if `m_pNextWorkstation` does not exist it writes: `ITEM_NAME --> END OF LINE`.
  - the messages are terminated with an endline

- `Workstation& operator+=(CustomerOrder&&)` – moves the parameter onto the back of the `CustomerOrder` queue.




## `LineManager` class

A `LineManager` object manages the entire assembly line and contains the following information:

- `std::vector<Workstation*> AssemblyLine` – A container containing all the references of the `Workstation` objects on the assembly line
- `std::deque<CustomerOrder> ToBeFilled` – A queue of customer orders to be filled
- `std::deque<CustomerOrder> Completed` – A queue of customer orders completed
- `unsigned int m_cntCustomerOrder` – The number of `CustomerOrder` objects the assembly line started with.

The member functions of the `LineManager` class include:
- custom constructor
  - with the following arguments:
    - a reference to an unmodifiable `std::string`.  This string contains the filename specified by the user to be used for linking the assembly line objects (example:  `AssemblyLine.txt`)
    - a reference to a `std::vector<Workstation*>` that contains the addresses of all the `Workstation` objects created for the assembly line
    - a reference to a `std::vector<CustomerOrder>` that contains all the `CustomerOrder` objects to be filled
  - the constructor will:
    - read the records from file and setup all the `m_pNextStation` references in the `Workstation` objects, linking each `Workstation` object together to form the assembly line
    - Move all the `CustomerOrder` objects onto the back of the `ToBeFilled` queue
    - Copy all the `Workstation` objects into the `AssemblyLine` container

- `bool run(std::ostream& os)` –  this function performs **one** cycle of operations on the assembly line by doing the following:
  - Insert into `os` the iteration number (how many times this function has been called by the client; use only local variables to count) in the format `Line Manager Iteration: COUNT<endl>`
  - If there are any `CustomerOrder` objects in the `ToBeFilled` queue, move the one at the front of the queue onto the starting point of the `AssemblyLine` (you have to identify which station is the starting point of your assembly line). Only one order can be moved on the assembly line on each call to this function.
  - Loop through all stations on the assembly line and run one cycle of the station's process
  - Loop through all stations on the assembly line and move the `CustomerOrder` objects down the line.
    - **Hint:**  completed orders should be moved into the `Completed` queue.
  - return `true` if all customer orders have been filled, otherwise returns `false`.
- `void displayCompletedOrders(std::ostream& os) const` -- displays all the orders that were completed
- `void displayStations() const` -- display all stations on the assembly line in the order they were received from the client
- `void displayStationsSorted() const` -- display all stations on the assembly line in the order they are linked.
